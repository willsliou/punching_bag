1. <s>Find out way to land continuous punches without manually reloading program. (Created time counter and set it to 1 minute)</s>
2. Highlight when punches land (Insert if statement that checks if any axis is above a certain value?) or only write onto text file if punches are above a single value.
3. Calculate total force by multiplying by punching bag weight (60lbs), and plot data with Tableu


Increase accuracy -> adjust punching bag center of gravity
